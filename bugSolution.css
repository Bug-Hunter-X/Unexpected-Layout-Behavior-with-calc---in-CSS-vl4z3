Ensure that parent container has explicitly defined dimensions (width or height). Example: Use `width: 100vw;` or a fixed width for the parent. 

If the intent is to adjust content relative to the parent, ensure the parent has dimensions set.

If avoiding explicit parent dimension setting is required, consider using viewport units (vw, vh) instead of percentages within `calc()`. Example: `calc(100vw - 10px);` which will calculate it correctly relative to viewport.
